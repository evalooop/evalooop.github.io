The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sort_matrix` function with an example matrix. \n\nWhen you run this code, it will print the original matrix and the sorted matrix. The rows in the sorted matrix will be ordered based on their sum, from smallest to largest. \n\nFor instance, given the matrix `[[3, 6, 9], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the output will be:\n```\nOriginal Matrix:\n[3, 6, 9]\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n\nSorted Matrix:\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[3, 6, 9]\n``` \n\nThis shows that the rows are sorted based on their sum: `1+2+3=6`, `4+5+6=15`, and `3+6+9=18`. \n\nNote that this code assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists, where each inner list has the same length (i.e., the matrix is rectangular). If the input matrix is not rectangular, the code may not work as expected. \n\nAlso, this code uses the built-in `sorted` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in Python, where n is the number of rows in the matrix. This makes the code efficient for large matrices. \n\nHowever, if you need to sort the matrix based on other criteria, such as the sum of each column or the maximum value in each row, you would need to modify the `key` function accordingly. \n\nFor example, to sort the matrix based on the sum of each column, you could use the `key` function `key=lambda row: sum(row)` and transpose the matrix before sorting, like this:\n```python\ndef sort_matrix_by_column_sum(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts a 2D list (matrix) based on the sum of each column.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix (list): A 2D list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A sorted 2D list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    transposed_matrix = list(map(list, zip(*matrix)))\n    \n    # Sort the transposed matrix based on the sum of each row (which corresponds to the sum of each column in the original matrix)\n    sorted_transposed_matrix = sorted(transposed_matrix, key=sum)\n    \n    # Transpose the sorted transposed matrix back to the original form\n    sorted_matrix = list(map(list, zip(*sorted_transposed_matrix)))\n    \n    return sorted_matrix\n``` \n\nThis code first transposes the matrix using the `zip` function, then sorts the transposed matrix based on the sum of each row (which corresponds to the sum of each column in the original matrix), and finally transposes the sorted transposed matrix back to the original form. \n\nYou can use this function in a similar way to the `sort_matrix` function, like this:\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Example usage:\n    matrix = [[3, 6, 9], [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n    print(\"Original Matrix:\")\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(row)\n    \n    sorted_matrix = sort_matrix_by_column_sum(matrix)\n    print(\"\\nSorted Matrix:\")\n    for row in sorted_matrix:\n        print(row)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n``` \n\nThis will print the original matrix and the sorted matrix, where the rows are ordered based on the sum of each column. \n\nNote that this code assumes that the input matrix is a list\nassert sort_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]])==[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]\n\"\"\"\n"
